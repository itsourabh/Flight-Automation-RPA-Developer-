✈️ Flight Automation – RPA Developer Project
📌 Overview

Flight Automation is an RPA-based project designed to automate end-to-end flight-related tasks such as flight search, price comparison, airline selection, and booking validation.
The automation eliminates repetitive manual work, reduces human errors, and improves efficiency using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) best practices.

This project is ideal for demonstrating real-world RPA skills, especially in web automation, data extraction, decision logic, and exception handling.

🎯 Business Problem

-> Manual flight search and booking processes are:
-> Time-consuming
-> Error-prone
-> Inconsistent across platforms
-> Users often need to:
-> Compare multiple airlines
-> Select the cheapest or preferred flight
-> Capture flight details for reporting

✅ Automation Objectives

The automation is capable of:
🔍 Searching flights on airline/aggregator websites
💰 Identifying cheapest / highest-priced flights
✈️ Selecting flights based on:

-> Airline name
-> Flight number
-> Price preference

📊 Extracting flight data into structured format (JSON / Excel)
🖱️ Automatically clicking the selected flight
🧪 Highlighting the selected flight/button for validation
⚠️ Handling dynamic web elements and exceptions

🧠 Key Features

-> Configurable selection modes
-> Cheapest flight
-> Highest price flight
-> Specific airline
-> Specific flight number
-> Dynamic web table handling
-> Robust error handling
-> Reusable and scalable logic
-> Clean logging for debugging
-> Data-driven automation
